# WikiRacer #

WikiRacer is an iOS application based on the [Wiki Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game "Wiki Game title"). 

In this game, the player is given a beginning and target Wiki article. They start off on the beginning article and try to navigate to the target one in the fastest time or least amount of referential links possible.

## Singleplayer ##

For singleplayer mode, the game can be played by an individual in a time trial environment where they can race against their own previous records and try to make it on a global leaderboard for specific topic pairings. The player would have the option to play a random game or choose their own Wiki article topics.

## Multiplayer ##

Multiplayer offers two different selections: joining a random game or creating a game. Joining a random game will pair the user with other players and start a game. On the other hand, creating a game allows the user to have an invite code for friends to join and the host of the game has the option to choose a random game or to pre-select the topics. 

## Leaderboard ##

Users will be ranked based on the number of multiplayer games they have won.

## Character ##

Users can customize their racer.

## My Stats ##

Users can view their stats on the number of games they completed.
